This project, which involved five Swiss universities, has been financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation (2013-2018).

The project has investigated curriculum policy and politics in Switzerland (1830s-2000s). In modern societies, schooling has become the primary institutions for systematically passing on knowledge from one generation to the next. The aim of the project has been twofold. First, we have traced the knowledge inscribed in official syllabi and schoolbooks of a selected sample of 13 linguistically, politically, and economically diverse Swiss sub-states (Cantons), focusing on its historical development and local variations. Second,  we have investigated the institutional and historical contexts, as well as political and scientific debate that have determined what should be taught in schools.

In addition to acting as the coordinator in this project, my focus within the project has been on issues concerning language curricula, curriculum politics, as well as gender differentiation in schooling.
