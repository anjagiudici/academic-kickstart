In the last few years, however, several studies have not only disclosed similarities between different fascist regimes and movements across Europe, but have also shown how their mutual relationships and exchanges shaped their ideology and practices. Fascist movements all over Europe founded their political preferences and policies on the principles of the (racial) superiority of the native monistically conceived Volksgemeinschaft, as well as the superiority of authoritarianism and a strong charismatic leadership over liberal democracy. In general, educational institutions, from the family, to youth organisations, to schooling, were considered crucial, as they provided a theatre in which of a strong, healthy national community could be moulded. This project represents an attempt by colleagues and myself to integrate this novel conception of pre- and interwar fascism into the history and politics of education.



The project has brought together scholars interested in the educational ideas and practices of authoritarian regimes and movements across interwar Europe, focussing specifically on countries outside of the traditional – and well-studied – cradles of fascism. The result have been a number of studies on the educational ideas and policy proposal of Swiss interwar fascism as well as a forthcoming special issue that brings together articles from different European areas, vividly demonstrating how, in the 1920s and 1930s, the proliferation of fascism stirred new dynamics in education circles across Europe and forced them to take a stance.
